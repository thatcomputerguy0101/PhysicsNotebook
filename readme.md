# PhysicsNotebook

Beta version available at https://thatcomputerguy0101.github.io/PhysicsNotebook/.

A web-based notebook program centered around algebraically solving symbolic equations as traditionally done for Physics problems. Utilizes [React.js](https://react.dev) for component layout, [Math.js](https://mathjs.org) for algebraic computation, [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com) for equation formatting, and [tex-math-parser](https://github.com/davidtranhq/tex-math-parser) to convert between Math.js syntax and LaTex syntax (for MathQuill) with better expression support than the default Math.js conversion.
